entries **in place**; never append dated sections. One entry per

`AGENTS.md` for the binding rules and
`shared_scripts/development_log.py` for the validator.

## States

`proposed` → `in_progress` → `in_review` → `shipped`, with `parked`
reachable from any live state and `abandoned` from `parked`.
`shipped` never returns to `in_progress`; open a new entry instead.

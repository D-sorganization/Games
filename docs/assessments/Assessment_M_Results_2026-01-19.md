# Assessment M Results: Educational Resources & Tutorials

## Executive Summary

Educational resources are minimal. The codebase itself is the primary resource. It is clean enough to learn from, but lacks explicit tutorials.

*   **Tutorials**: None.
*   **Comments**: Code is well-commented.
*   **Architecture Docs**: Missing.

## Scorecard

| **Learning Curve** | **6/10** | Code is readable. | Add diagrams. |

## Remediation Roadmap

**6 Weeks**:

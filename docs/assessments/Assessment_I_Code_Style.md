# Assessment I: Code Style

## Grade: 10/10

## Analysis
The code style is exemplary. The project enforces `mypy` strict mode, `ruff` linting/formatting, and follows modern Python practices (Type Hints, Pathlib, f-strings). The code is consistent, readable, and professional.

## Strengths
- **Strict Typing**: `mypy --strict` passing is a high bar that is met.
- **Modern Syntax**: Consistent use of Python 3.10+ features.
- **Configuration**: Explicit `ruff.toml` and `mypy.ini` ensure consistency.

## Weaknesses
- None significantly observed.

## Recommendations
1.  **Maintain Vigilance**: Continue to enforce these standards as the codebase grows.

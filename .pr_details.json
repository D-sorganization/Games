{"body":"Corrected `mypy.ini` `exclude` pattern (removing invalid TOML-style list syntax) and added `explicit_package_bases = True` to correctly handle the project's namespace package structure. \n\nResolved 30+ type errors exposed by enabling proper type checking, including:\n- Added `TypedDict` and explicit annotations in `scripts/generate_assessment_summary.py` and `scripts/analyze_completist_data.py`.\n- Fixed logic in `scripts/shared/assessment_utils.py` to correctly handle `None` values for AST nodes.\n- Refactored `scripts/run_assessment.py` to use a `is_scored` flag instead of `Optional[int]` for safer type narrowing.\n- Annotated `health`, `alive`, and `pitch` attributes in `Player` classes across `Duum`, `Force_Field`, and `Zombie_Survival` to resolve cross-module type inference issues.\n\nThe repository now passes `mypy .` without errors, satisfying strict `AGENTS.md` requirements.\n\n---\n*PR created automatically by Jules for task [2956628235948716973](https://jules.google.com/task/2956628235948716973) started by @dieterolson*\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> <sup>[Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) is generating a summary for commit 8c5cc0266f2fffc284965592e4dbf0f76ff17f75.

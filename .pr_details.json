{"body":"Implemented a quality review process that targets files identified in `.jules/review_data/diffs.txt`.\nCreated a new script `scripts/generate_quality_review.py` which checks for:\n- God Functions (>200 lines Critical, >100 Major)\n- DRY Violations (>5 Critical, >2 Major)\n- Secrets (Critical)\n- Broad Exception Handling (Major/Critical)\n- Magic Numbers (Major)\n\nGenerated the assessment report at `docs/assessments/Assessment_Quality_Review.md` which lists 10 Critical issues found in the codebase.\n\n---\n*PR created automatically by Jules for task [8958254898234883539](https://jules.google.com/task/8958254898234883539) started by @dieterolson*\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Low Risk**\n> Mostly adds an offline analysis script and generated documentation/JSON artifacts; no runtime app logic is modified.\n> \n> **Overview**\n> Adds `scripts/generate_quality_review.py`, which parses `.jules/review_data/diffs.txt` to find changed Python files and runs heuristic checks for **DRY duplication**, **oversized (“god”) functions**, **potential hardcoded secrets**, **broad `except Exception` usage**, and **magic-number density**, emitting both JSON and Markdown outputs.\n> \n> Commits the generated reports (`docs/assessments/Assessment_Quality_Review.md` and `docs/assessments/assessment_quality_review.json`) and refreshes the Pragmatic Programmer assessment artifacts (`docs/assessments/pragmatic_programmer/review.{json,md}`) primarily with updated timestamps and minor issue list churn.\n> \n> <sup>Written by [Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) for commit a4db9da665ba06ecc1fa2c6e9a05efb58aacefaf.

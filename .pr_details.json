{"body":"This PR addresses static analysis failures exposed by fixing the `mypy` configuration. It includes fixes for invalid INI syntax, missing type annotations in scripts, potential runtime crashes in assessment utilities, and explicit type hints for `Player` subclasses in games to ensure correct type inference across module boundaries. All tests and static analysis checks now pass.\n\n---\n*PR created automatically by Jules for task [917159439377610175](https://jules.google.com/task/917159439377610175) started by @dieterolson*\n\n<!-- CURSOR_SUMMARY -->\n---\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> <sup>[Cursor Bugbot](https://cursor.com/dashboard?tab=bugbot) is generating a summary for commit 055412be1e8286d5c4db48d9a4a24cdb554162db.
